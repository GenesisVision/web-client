            Money laundering is a process of concealing the true origin and

            of criminal activities such as illicit drugs, corruption, organized
            crime, fraud, sex trade, forgery, illegal logging/fishing, revenue
            evasion, counterfeit money, piracy, terrorism etc... which criminals

            legitimate businesses and &#39;shell&#39; companies. In most cases,
            the proceeds of these criminal activities take the form of cash.

            Layering is the separation of criminal proceeds from their source by
            creating complex layering process of financial transactions designed
            to defeat the audit trail and provide anonymity. It may include
            telegraphically transferring funds overseas, depositing cash
            overseas, reselling goods previously with cash.

            Integration provides apparent legitimacy to criminally derived

            financial system appearing to be legitimate business funds. This may
            be achieved through a complex web of transfers or income from
            apparently legitimate businesses previously purchased with the
            proceeds of illegal activities.

            Terrorist financing involves collecting and providing funds for

            international organization to do or abstain from doing any act&#39;.
            The goal of the terrorist or terrorist organization is to maintain
            financial support in order to achieve their aims, and a successful

            Generally, Money Laundering occurs in three stages. Cash first
            enters the financial system at the &quot;placement&quot; stage,
            where the cash generated from criminal activities is converted into
            monetary instruments, such as money orders or traveler&#39;s checks,
            or deposited into accounts at financial institutions. At the
            &quot;layering&quot; stage, the funds are transferred or moved into
            other accounts or other financial institutions to further separate
            the money from its criminal origin. At the &quot;integration&quot;
            stage, the funds are reintroduced into the economy and used to
            purchase legitimate assets or to fund other criminal activities or
            legitimate businesses. Terrorist Financing may not involve the
            proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to conceal the
            origin or intended use of the funds, which will later be used for
            criminal purposes. Both individual employees and the Company itself
            are liable for criminal conduct if any of the offences below are
            charged by authorities. Money Laundering offences can be distributed
            as follows:

              Handling the proceeds of corruption - corruption by government
