        <p>
          A cookie is a small amount of data that often includes a unique
          identifier that is sent to your computer or device browser from a
          website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive for
          tracking site usage. A website may send its own cookie to your browser
          if your browser's preferences allow it, but, to protect your privacy,
          your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has
          already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites.
